CircularBuffer.py:
    CircularBuffer.py has two classes. 

    CircularBuffer implements a basic circular buffer and provides related 
    methods for writing to and reading from it. It implements fractional delay
    meaning the buffer size being inputted when creating the buffer can also be floats.

    StereoDelay extends the functionality of CircularBuffer. It can take and
    return stereo audio. It works by setting up two circular buffers, one for 
    each channel, with their own delay times and operating on them individually.
    Solves the problem of having to do this in the main code.

    Examples of both of these classes in use can be seen in CircularBufferTest.ipynb.
