LowPass.ipynb:
    LowPass.ipynb explores different methods of implementing a low pass filter. 
    From difference equation, transfer function and using built in scipy.signal functions. 
    I looked at the differences in using butterworth filters and chebyshev filters.
    While chebyshev type 1 filters might be useful for having a resonant peak in the frequency
    response, I decided butterworth filters would be more applicable for my uses.
    I need to look into JUCE's built in filter design functions as they may have their own way of
    creating this resonance.
    I looked at the differences in orders of filters and steepness of the transition.


HighPass.ipynb:
    HighPass.ipynb looks at methods for implementing a high pass filter. I didn't do as much 
    experimentation here as it is almost the exact same as a low pass.
    I also looked at the differences in the orders of filters and the steepness of the transition.


BandPass.ipynb:
    BandPass.ipynb looks at implementations of band pass filters.


Notch.ipynb:
    Notch.ipynb looks at notch/bandstop filter implementations.
