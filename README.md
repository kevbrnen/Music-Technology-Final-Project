# Real Time Audio Effect Processing
## A JUCE Effects Suite Plug-in Implementation
## Music Technology Final Project 2024

### Introduction
This repository contains all Python prototyping and C++ JUCE implementation code for my Final Project. The Idea for my project was to investigate different types of effects and prototype them in Python. From this I could create an Effects Suite VST plug-in using JUCE. My main goals for the project were to:
* Make a tangible VST plug-in I could use myself, that I would know the ins and outs of, and one that couls also act as a portfolio of audio programming.
* Get a better understanding of audio signal processing and of the inner workings of the effects I wanted to look into.
* Learn JUCE and create something with it.
* Create something using everything I have learned in both Music Technology and Computer Science.
* Improve my C++ skills.
* Improve my Python skills.

### Description
The project is broken down into different folders:
- [Impulse Responses] contains all code relating to, and any recordings of impulse responses I used in the project.
- [JUCE Code] contains all JUCE project files and source code for my plug-in.
- [LFOs] contains some code for creating custom LFOs.
- [NTS-1] contains some effect testing code for the Korg NTS-1.
- [Prototyping] contains all of my prototyping code.
- [Sound Examples] contains some sound examples I created throughout the course of the project and for progress colloquiums
