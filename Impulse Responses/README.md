## Recorded Responses folder - 
    Contains raw recorded responses, not trimmed

## IR_measurement_2022_stimulus_final.wav - 
    The interrupted noise and sine sweep recording used 

## ExtractingResponses - 
    ExtractingResponses.ipynb shows an example of how impulse responses can be extracted
    using different methods; 

    claps/baloon pops: where the sound itself is the impulse

    Interrupted noise: where the decay of the noise after it stops is the impulse

    Sine sweep: where we use inverse convolution with the original sweep to obtain the impulse
